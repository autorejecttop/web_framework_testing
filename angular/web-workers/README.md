# Why?

1. I suppose the usage of Web Workers is for anything that doesn't correlate with UI
2. It will make the "rendering" performance of the site "better"
3. It will make the data fetching and something that "can be done in the background" not interrupt the renderer
4. Look more into this, it's [interesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)
