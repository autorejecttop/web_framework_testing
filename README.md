# web_framework_testing

This repository is for my personal testing of web frameworks and JS ecosystem.

## List of web frameworks to learn

### Important ones

- React. Have actually known this for a while, but I'm currently doing some **_advanced_** stuff in it by looking at their [tutorial](react.dev/learn).
- Next.js. Will learn about this just for the job, I don't really like SSR that much since I don't want a node process running when I can just offload it to the clients.
- Express. The same with React, wanted to refresh my memory
- NestJS. this is gaining in popularity, their docs are pretty comprehensive hence why I want to learn it.
- Elysia. this one is just for my personal stuff, even though they will not see the light of production.

### Just for the luls
- SolidJS. kinda liked how it feels like React but less bloat. Kinda felt like using a simple JavaScript wrapper for declarative UI.
- Astro. kinda liked how it's very barebones, even though a lot of people don't use this.
- <canvas> and JS optimization. I'm very curious on the performance of using <canvas> as a renderer rather than DOM and also doing some very niche stuff like Map, Set, or even some unknown JS APIs that people don't hear often.
